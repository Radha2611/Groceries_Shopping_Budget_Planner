🛍️ Smart Budget Basket

**Smart Budget Basket** is a simple, interactive web app that helps you plan your shopping smartly using optimization logic — inspired by the **Fractional Knapsack Algorithm**.  
You can add your items, assign their importance (value), and set a total budget. The app then calculates the most valuable combination of items you can buy within your budget.
